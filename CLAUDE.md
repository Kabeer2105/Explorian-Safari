---

## 🎯 Client-Specific Requirements (Updated 2026-01-11)

### Critical Business Logic:

1. **Request Travel Offer / Quote System** ⭐ PRIORITY
   - Prominent "Request Travel Offer" button (like tanzaniaspecialist.de)
   - Custom quote request form with detailed trip preferences
   - Admin receives detailed inquiry with customer requirements
   - Customers receive acknowledgment email

2. **Smart Booking Flow Based on Travel Date** ⭐ CRITICAL
   - **If trip is < 7 days away:**
     - Customer submits inquiry
     - Automatic email: "We will reach out to you shortly to arrange your booking"
     - No payment processing (too urgent for online booking)
     - Admin gets high-priority notification

   - **If trip is ≥ 7 days away:**
     - Full booking flow activated
     - Multi-step booking process
     - Payment gateway integration
     - Automated confirmation

3. **Content Management Philosophy** ⭐ ESSENTIAL
   - Admin dashboard must allow client to edit EVERYTHING possible
   - No programmer needed for routine updates
   - Editable content includes:
     - Package details (name, description, price, images)
     - Itineraries
     - Inclusions/exclusions
     - Pricing and currency

     - Testimonials (manual ones)
     - Contact information

   - WYSIWYG editor for rich text content
   - Drag-and-drop image management

   - ❌ Blog/Vlog section (removed)
   - ❌ Live chat support (WhatsApp is sufficient)
   - ❌ Interactive maps (Google Maps API too expensive)

5. **Features TO INCLUDE:**
